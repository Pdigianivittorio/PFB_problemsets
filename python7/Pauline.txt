Pauline by Shel Silverstein

Pauline loves me,
Pauline cares,
Pauline picks me peaches and pears.
Pauline offers me candy and Cokes,
Pauline listens and laughs at me jokes.
Pauline helps when I get in a fight,
Pauline does all my homework at night.
Pauline misses me,
Pauline cries,
Pauline thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Pauline is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Pauline just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Pauline's hand,
In the darkness where Pauline usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Pauline's gone!
