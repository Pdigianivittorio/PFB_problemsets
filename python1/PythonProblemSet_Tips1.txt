Python 1 Problem Set 

To store something as a variable: 
	EX: age = 30
	EX: name = "PaulineDigianivittorio" 
	EX: favorite_color = "Green" 
	EX: favorite_activity = "Reading" 
	EX: favorite_animal = "Honey Badger" 


	- you can change the name part to something more descriptive to make it easier to track. But you are just in the interpreter so this 	is suffice. 

To print the contents of the variable: 
	EX: print (name)

To exit python interpreter: 
	EX: exit () or quit () 

When creating a script in python: 
- it is highly suggested to start your script on line 1 using #!/usr/bin/env python3
- then when you run the script on the terminal you can use either python3 pythonscript.py OR ./pythonscript.py
	!!! if you use the second option, you MUST have the #!/usr/bin/env python 3 on the first line of the script
	!!! if you do not have the #!/usr/bin/env in the first line of the python script, you can use the python 3 pythonscript.py command 	to activate python 3 to run the script.

To write a script you can either use VS code (Visual Studio Code) or you can use vi 

You can create defined variables in a script or you can create a script that defines the variables when you are interacting with the command line. 



EX: Making a list of defined variables and then running the script on the command line (using UNIX) to print the list of variables: 
#!/usr/bin/env python3

#Making a list of defined variables 

my_name = "PaulineDiGianivittorio"
print ("my name:", my_name)

my_favorite_color = "Green"
print ("my favorite color:", my_favorite_color)

my_favorite_activity = "Reading"
print ("my favorite activity:", my_favorite_activity)

favorite_animal = "Honey Badger"
print ("my favorite animal:", favorite_animal)

#trying F"" string formatting"
print (f"my name: {my_name}")

my_favorite_color = "Green"
print (f"my favorite color: {my_favorite_color}")



EX: You can also define variables in a script but say what you want to print as those variables in the command line. 

#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys

#this is also another way to generate list where you would define the variables on the command lin
#to do this you would use sys.argv [1] etc, here and then define the variable in the command line 
#When completing lists in this way, it is important to write import sys in the line under the #!usr/bin/env python3

name = sys.argv [1]
print ("my name:", name)

favorite_color = sys.argv [2]
print ("my favorite color:", favorite_color)

favorite_activity = sys.argv [3]
print ("my favorite activity:", favorite_activity)

favorite_animal = sys.argv [4]
print ("my favorite animal:", favorite_animal)
