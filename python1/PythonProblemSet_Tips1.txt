Python 1 Problem Set 

To store something as a variable: 
	EX: age = 30
	EX: name = "PaulineDigianivittorio" 
	EX: favorite_color = "Green" 
	EX: favorite_activity = "Reading" 
	EX: favorite_animal = "Honey Badger" 


	- you can change the name part to something more descriptive to make it easier to track. But you are just in the interpreter so this 	is suffice. 

To print the contents of the variable: 
	EX: print (name)

To exit python interpreter: 
	EX: exit () or quit () 

When creating a script in python: 
- it is highly suggested to start your script on line 1 using #!/usr/bin/env python3
- then when you run the script on the terminal you can use either python3 pythonscript.py OR ./pythonscript.py
	!!! if you use the second option, you MUST have the #!/usr/bin/env python 3 on the first line of the script
	!!! if you do not have the #!/usr/bin/env in the first line of the python script, you can use the python 3 pythonscript.py command 	to activate python 3 to run the script.
